This project is part of My Final Assignment at Polytechnic Institute of Nuclear Technology's Virtual Visit Application for Kartini Reactor using Virtual Reality based on Unity

**THIS REPOSITORY IS ONLY FOR DISTRIBUTING THE APPLICATION AND CODES CREATED BY ME FOR THE APPLICATION ASIDE FROM THE CODES THAT ALREADY PROVIDED BY UNITY**

Please look forward to it!
